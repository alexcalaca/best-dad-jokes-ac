# Best dad jokes

> Dad jokes generator made by AC Alexandre Cala√ßa

<br/>

The `Best dad jokes` project generates dad jokes by using the icanhazdadjokes API. icanhazdadjoke.com is the largest selection of dad jokes on the internet.

This project consumes data from icanhazdadjokes.com to generate dad jokes on screen when a user hits one of the two buttons. Fetch and Async are used in order to get JSON data from the web API. The DOM manipulation is all done with vanilla JavaScript.
